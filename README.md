This project was made with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, MongoDB. Primary DB functionaility consists of: creating a collection that holds users posts with another collection that holds comments based on that post. This project was fun and challenging to make.

I learned the power of NoSQL or non relational databases and how they could be used effectively to create an application. No matter how skilled you are as a developer, never stop learning or striving to continue improving your knowledge!
